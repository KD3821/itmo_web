                        MongoDB, Cassandra, Apache storm, Sphinx - These are the NoSQL databases. Their only commonality is that they 
                        do not use a relational database scheme. This type of database covers a wide range of technologies and can be 
                        used to find key-value DB, graph DBs, streaming DBs etc.,
                    </p>

                        VoltDB and MemSQL- These are a new kind of database, the NewSQL. They follow the relational scheme but instead
                        of disks, they use memory. the advantage is that they outperform the traditional RDBMS but the limited amount 
                        of memory available is definitely a downside to this type of database.

                        made to any code stored in its repository. Check out the git basics before getting started. GitHub is the most 
                        widely used code repository, and therefore a must learn for an aspiring coder. A GitHub roadmap is a crucial 
                        part in the full-stack learning course.

                        HTTPS is the secured version of HTTP. Here, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer 
                        Security. It ensures protection against man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping.

                        Data structures and algorithms - Data structures are different ways of storing data, while an algorithm is a 
                        generic approach methodology to solve a problem or requirement. Every programmer needs to be familiar with 
                        these concepts. These are not core skills, but the more intuitive you are about these, the easier it is to 
                        solve issues or add requirements. The impacts are felt in efficiency, scalability and performance of an application. 
                        As a full stack developer, these courses will help you immensely.
